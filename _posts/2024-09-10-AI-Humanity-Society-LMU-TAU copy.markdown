The LMU-TAU Research Cooperation Program was established in 2017 as a joint program between Tel Aviv University (TAU) and LMU Munich. Its goal is to strengthen collaboration between the two universities in all areas of research. The workshop "AI-Humanity-Society" focuses on exploring the intersection of AI, machine learning, and generative AI with social sciences and humanities, aimed at early-career researchers. It includes an online session on November 19, 2024, followed by a funded in-person meeting in March 2025 for participants from LMU and TAU. Applications are open until September 27, 2024, and selected participants will be notified by the end of October.
