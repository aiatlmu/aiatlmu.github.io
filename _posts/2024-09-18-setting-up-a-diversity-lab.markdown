excerpt: "Explore how dissimilarity concepts can enhance fairness-aware data practices in machine learning at this interdisciplinary workshop led by Prof. Dr. Christoph Kern."
---

This workshop, will discuss how concepts of dissimilarity can inform fairness-aware data practices. This includes discussing what the fairness in machine learning (fair ML) literature has to offer for advancing responsible empirical research across academic disciplines. Research in fair ML focuses on the social implications of prediction-based decision models and develops methods to quantify and mitigate biases that may adversely impact social groups. However, the scope of fair ML spans beyond fair prediction modeling as it invites reflection on the conceptualization of historical disadvantage and on diversity in datasets.
