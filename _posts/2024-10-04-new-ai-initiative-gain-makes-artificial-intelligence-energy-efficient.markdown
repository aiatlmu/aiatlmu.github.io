The GAIn Project (Next Generation AI Computing), a collaboration between the Free States of Bavaria and Saxony, focuses on developing energy-efficient AI technologies. The research team, which is headed by [Prof. Dr. Gitta Kutyniok](https://www.ai.math.uni-muenchen.de/members/professor/kutyniok/index.html) (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München), also consists of [Prof. Dr. Holger Boche](https://www.professoren.tum.de/boche-holger) (Technische Universität München), as well as [Prof. Dr. Stefanie Speidel](https://tu-dresden.de/tu-dresden/profil/exzellenz/bright-minds/prof-Stefanie-Speidel) and [Prof. Dr. Frank Fitzek](https://tu-dresden.de/tu-dresden/profil/exzellenz/bright-minds/Prof-Frank-Fitzek) (both Technische Universität Dresden), with [baiosphere](https://baiosphere.org/), the [Digital Agency Saxony](https://www.digitalagentur.sachsen.de/), and several companies or start-ups as network partners. Backed by a €6 million investment from both Ministries of Science, the initiative aims to create innovative AI hardware and software solutions to reduce energy consumption while addressing predictability, reliability, and legal compliance challenges.
