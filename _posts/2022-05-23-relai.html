				<p style="text-align: justify">A joint initiative of TUM and LMU has achieved a major success in the competition for the leading artificial intelligence researchers of the future. Both universities together will start the “<b>Konrad Zuse School of Excellence for Reliable AI</b>” to train future generations of AI experts in Germany who combine technical brilliance with awareness of the importance of AI’s reliability. <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/guennemann-stephan">Prof. Dr. Stephan Günnemann</a>, Professor of Data Analytics and Machine Learning at TUM is spokesperson for the school, while <a href="https://www.ai.math.uni-muenchen.de/members/professor/kutyniok/index.html">Prof. Dr. Gitta Kutyniok</a>, (Bavarian AI Chair for Mathematical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence) at LMU is co-spokesperson.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify">The school will focus on the reliability of AI technology. Aspects such as safety, security, privacy-preservation and responsibility are essential prerequisites for the use of AI in domains of public interest. The school will educate top international candidates in the development of reliable AI systems, both for industry and academia, and train them in cutting-edge research to make AI ready for deployment in critical application domains. MSc and Doctoral candidates will be embedded in an excellent environment with fellows from both universities, a network of international AI centers and in Munich’s “Isar Valley”.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify">The funding program Konrad <a href="https://www.daad.de/de/infos-services-fuer-hochschulen/weiterfuehrende-infos-zu-daad-foerderprogrammen/konrad-zuse-schools/">Zuse Schools of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence</a> aims to provide excellent, research-based training for outstanding German and non-German students at master’s degree and doctorate level in order to strengthen the standing of German AI research and application in the context of international competition. The schools will combine inter-university, innovative teaching and learning formats and a close connection to the digital economy.  </p>

				<p style="text-align: justify">A total of 18 project proposals were submitted within the funding initiative. Three projects were selected throughout Germany, for which the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research will provide initial funding of 24 million euros. The schools will be launched in July 2022, the first cohort of students will already start their studies in the upcoming winter semester 2022/23. </p>
