As continuation of the successful CAS research focus [Next Generation AI](https://www.en.cas.uni-muenchen.de/research_focus/next_generation_ai/index.html) and in accordance with the unique position of LMU in the AI-revolution of our society, a founding member meeting with researchers from various faculties took place for the preparation of a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Center at LMU.

Artificial Intelligence will change our society in an unprecedented way in the coming years with the area of data science playing a similarly crucial role due to the heavy dependence of artificial intelligence on high quality training data. This very rapidly developing massive transformation of our society has already by now a tremendous impact on the sciences such as on methodological sciences (computer science, mathematics, statistics) for developing reliable AI approaches, on economics for preparing the future economy, on legal studies for developing new laws and regulations, or on social studies for analyzing societal and ethical impacts.

LMU is optimally prepared to take on a leading role in Germany and Europe in the AI-revolution of our society due to the facts that it not only covers the entire spectrum of relevant areas of sciences with internationally leading AI-researchers in all faculties often newly recruited by the Bavarian Hightech Agenda, but also has a very strong and highly interdisciplinary group of top experts in data science. During the last two years, the research focus “Next Generation AI” of the Center for Advanced Studies LMU has in addition already connected the respective researchers, creating a strong data science and AI community at LMU. 

As a consequent next step, on April 13, a founding member meeting for a new Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Center at LMU has taken place with 37 professors from 12 different faculties being present.
During this, a preliminary version of the statues for a future center were agreed upon, and the founding board of directors consisting of the Professors [Bernd Bischl](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/people/bischl/), [Eyke Hüllermeier](https://www.kiml.ifi.lmu.de/people/professors/huellermeier/index.html), [Michael Ingrisch](https://www.lmu-klinikum.de/radiologie/forschung/clinical-data-science/0e8a3ac188dad3f9), [Frauke Kreuter](https://www.soda.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/people/professors/kreuter1/index.html), [Jochen Kuhn](https://www.didaktik.physik.uni-muenchen.de/lehrstuhlleitung/index.html), [Gitta Kutyniok](https://www.ai.math.uni-muenchen.de/members/professor/kutyniok/index.html), [Björn Ommer](https://ommer-lab.com/people/ommer/), [Alexander Wuttke](https://www.alexander-wuttke.de/), and the postdoctoral researcher [Anna-Carolina Hänsch](https://www.soda.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/people/employees/haensch/index.html) were elected.  In a second meeting, Eyke Hüllermeier, Frauke Kreuter, and Gitta Kutyniok were elected as founding directors. The main goals of this emerging center are to promote and coordinate cooperations in research and education of the different disciplines at LMU while also fusing the two research areas of data science and AI for their mutual benefit, initiate programs with national and international research institutions, as well as cooperate and provide guidance for industry and politics.
