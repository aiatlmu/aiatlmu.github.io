DSSGx Munich 2024 will be hosting its closing ceremony on Wednesday, September 25th, 2024, 4-9pm at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Munich. The event will feature project presentations from DSSGx fellows, showcasing the outcomes of two months of collaborative work with project partners. Attendees will also hear a welcome address from Dr. Fabian Mehring, Bavaria's State Minister for Digital Affairs.

The two projects being presented focus on data-driven solutions for social challenges: one aims to balance tourism and nature protection in the Bavarian Forest National Park, while the other enhances preparedness for migration events through machine learning. Both presentations will include time for questions from the audience.

Ulrike KÃ¶ppen, Chief AI Officer at Bayerischer Rundfunk, will deliver a keynote on the importance of becoming a data-driven society for social good. The evening will conclude with closing remarks and a reception with drinks and a buffet.
