On the recommendation of a panel of experts, “AI as a major Minor” (AIM@LMU), a grant proposal submitted by LMU, will receive funding in the context of the research program on “Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education”. The scheme was set up, and is financed, jointly by the Federal Government and the States. Beginning in 2022, the AIM@LMU project will receive approximately 2 million euros over a period of 4 years. Its purpose is to design and implement a wide-ranging subsidiary study program devoted to the subject of Artificial Intelligence (AI). According to Prof. Eyke Hüllermeier, one of the applicants of the proposal and contact person at LMU, “the AIM@LMU Initiative not only represents an ideal addition to LMU’s current curriculum and research strategy, it will also complement the 15 new professorships in the AI field provided by the High-Tech Agenda for Bavaria.” “The project also fits in very well with our teaching programs at the Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML),” says Prof. Bernd Bischl, Co-Director of the MCML, who also contributed to the grant application. “We also plan to make resources available for personnel, provided that the MCML becomes a permanent institution.”
