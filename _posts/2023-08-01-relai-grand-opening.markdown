excerpt: On July 26th the Grand Opening of the Konrad Zuse School of Excellence took place in Munich. The vision of the ‘Konrad Zuse School of Excellence in Reliable AI’ (relAI) is to train future generations of AI experts, who for the first time combine technical brilliance with awareness of the importance of AI’s reliability. The school is embedded in the unique transdisciplinary Munich AI ecosystem, combining the expertise of the two Universities of Excellence TUM and LMU and closely integrates various non-university research institutions and industry partners.

Aspects such as security and the preservation of the private sphere are key prerequisites for the use of AI. A common reason for a lack of acceptance of AI-based technologies in society and industry is the concern about reliability.

The Zuse School relAI, opened yesterday by Bavarian science minister Markus Blume, will place greater emphasis on this perspective. Along with technical expertise, the school’s educational activities will provide future AI experts with a heightened understanding of the societal importance of reliable AI.

“In addition to educating AI experts, relAI will raise Germany’s international profile in this field and enhance the status of Munich in particular as an AI location. We want to make Munich attractive for international talent in order to recruit experts for the growing AI industry,” says Stephan Günnemann, a founding director of the Konrad Zuse School relAI, Executive Director of the Munich Data Science Institute and a Professor of Data Analytics and Machine Learning at TUM.
