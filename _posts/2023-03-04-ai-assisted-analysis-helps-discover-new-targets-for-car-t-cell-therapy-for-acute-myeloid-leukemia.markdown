The two-day event featured high-profile speakers from the global AI community, including representatives from MIT, the University of Amsterdam, and Imperial College London.

Among the keynote speakers were Dr. Markus SÃ¶der, Minister of Science and Art Markus Blume, Minister of Digital Affairs Judith Gerlach, and Minister of Economic Affairs Hubert Aiwanger. During the conference, the ministers emphasized the importance of establishing European AI.
