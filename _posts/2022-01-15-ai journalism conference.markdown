Co-organised by LMU's Professor Neil Thurman and Dr Bartosz Wilczek, this one day conference in Paris, France has two aims. Firstly, to better understand and model how the interplay between AI, journalistic professionals, and news audiences shapes the flow of news online. And, secondly, to better understand the technological, organizational, ethical/legal and societal conditions that facilitate the responsible use of AI in journalism.
