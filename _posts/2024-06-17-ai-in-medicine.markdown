The AI Keynote Series, hosted by LMU Munich's Institute AI is advancing significantly in medicine, particularly through the use of causal machine learning (ML) to improve diagnostics and therapy outcomes. An international research team led by [Prof. Dr. Stefan Feuerriegel](https://www.som.lmu.de/ai/en/institute/contact-page/stefan-feuerriegel-840c1071.html) from LMU has demonstrated that causal ML can enhance the effectiveness and safety of treatments by better estimating treatment outcomes compared to traditional ML methods. This advancement allows for more personalized treatment strategies, potentially improving medical practice. However, implementing these methods requires sophisticated modeling and collaboration between AI experts and medical professionals. The team's findings, published in Nature Medicine, indicate a promising future for causal ML in healthcare.
