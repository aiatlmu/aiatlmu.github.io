In a joint research project with the Université Laval in the Montreal project, Prof. Michael Ingrisch and Dr. Katharina Jeblick are looking at how artificial intelligence can optimally support radiological reporting. They are not concerned with the theoretical performance of AI systems in isolation, but above all with how these can be optimally embedded in clinical reality.  In doing so, they take a holistic approach – from data infrastructure to issues of technology assessment in healthcare. In particular, they will evaluate special aspects of different healthcare systems and identify recommendations for action. For this, the cooperation with Quebec is optimal. Their joint research project is supported by the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts.
