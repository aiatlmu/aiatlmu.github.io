  description: "Using digital trace data in combination with self-reports to answer social science
research questions by Florian Keusch (University of Mannheim)</br>
When people browse the Internet, post on social media platforms, use their smartphone, or
engage with other online information systems, they leave records of their activity. These
digital traces provide researchers with new opportunities for studying social and behavioral
phenomena. The excitement about digital trace data mainly stems from the fine-grained
nature of the data that potentially allows researchers to observe individual and social behavior
as well as changes in behavior at high frequencies and in real time. In addition, their
measurement is nonintrusive, that is, the data collection happens without the observed person
having to self-report. This talk will discuss the potential of digital trace data to answer a
broad range of social science research questions and how they can be combined with selfreports from surveys to provide a more complete picture of human behavior and social
interactions. Examples of how the two data sources can be collected and combined will be
presented.
</br></br>
Understanding conditioning in surveys and digital trace data by Alexandru Cernat (University of Manchester)</br>
Conditioning or mere-effects have long been a concern in social science data collection. This
is especially problematic in longitudinal data collection where participants can change their
behaviours and attitudes as a result of repeated observations. While digital trace data can
provide a possible solution to this problem, due to its lower intrusiveness, it is by no means
immune to it as people can change their behaviour when they are observed. In this talk we
will show how conditioning can effect both longitudinal surveys and digital trace data and
highlight how multiple (and longitudinal) data sources can be used to understand the
conditioning process. Time: 15:30-17:00"

  description: "Surveys face difficult choices in managing cost-error tradeoffs. Stopping rules have been proposed as a
method for managing these tradeoffs. A stopping rule will limit effort on cases in order to reduce costs
with minimal harm to quality. Previously proposed stopping rules have focused on quality with an
implicit assumption that all cases have the same cost. While this may be true for mail or web surveys,
this assumption is unlikely to be true for either telephone or face-to-face surveys. We propose a new
rule that looks at both predicted costs and quality. This rule is tested experimentally against another
rule that focuses on stopping cases that are expected to be difficult to recruit. We test both Bayesian
and non-Bayesian versions of the rule. The Bayesian version of the prediction models uses historical
data to establish prior information. We find that the new rule produces higher quality estimates for
about the same cost regardless of the use of prior information. Time: 15:30-17:00"

  description: "The size and diversity of the privacy stakeholder arena presents a challenge for systematically synthesizing its members' conversations and opinions. The TAPP (Transatlantic Privacy Perceptions) Panel aims to follow and analyze developments in stakeholders' attitudes, expectations and concerns around current and future topics in digital privacy over time through a cross-national, cross-sectoral survey of influential voices and experts in privacy.</br>
For reaching, recruiting, and retaining this unique population, a novel, tiered and targeted sampling and recruiting approach has been developed, combining systematic research for privacy experts with Twitter-based network and respondent-driven sampling techniques which are currently being tested in a pilot study.  The pilot seeks to use specific keywords related to privacy for recruiting individuals who are conversant about privacy topics into the panel. 
This talk will discuss the pilot study in particular and look at how one can leverage the infrastructure of a social media platform for survey recruitment based on user and content related variables. Time: 15:30-17:00"

</br>
</br>
When: Wednesdays 3-5pm</br>
Where: Geschw.-Scholl-Pl. 1 (A) - A 120</br>
Language: English and German</br></br>

In October 2021, the program "AIM@LMU - Künstliche Intelligenz als Nebenfach an der LMU" was approved as part of the federal and state funding initiative "Künstliche Intelligenz in der Hochschulbildung". The aim of the program is to design a broad, interdisciplinary range of courses in the field of artificial intelligence for as many courses of study at the LMU as possible. Students from a wide range of disciplines should be given the opportunity to supplement their primary field of study with a customized AI training. The interdisciplinary lecture series "AI in Science and Society" aims to highlight the social relevance of AI and the importance of AI for different scientific fields.

  description: 'There is an interesting new field developing at the intersection of the physical sciences and deep learning, sometimes called AI4Science. In one direction, tools developed in the AI community are used to solve problems in science, such as protein folding, molecular simulation, and so on. But also in the other direction, deep insights from mathematics and physics are inspiring new DL architectures, such as Neural ODE solvers, and equivariance. In this talk, I will start with mapping out some of the opportunities at this intersection and subsequently dive a little deeper into PDE solving. Also, in this subfield, cross fertilization has already happened both ways: people have used DL tools to successfully solve PDE equations much faster than with traditional solvers. But reversely, there are also efforts to use PDEs as “infinite width”, functional representations of layers in a deep NN architecture. The latter is helpful for instance to become independent of gridding choices. In the second half of this talk, I will explain our most recent efforts to solve PDEs faster and more accurately using DL, and reversely, new ways to use PDEs as an approximate equivariance prior.'

As with other products (architecture, furniture, food, cars, smartphones, etc.), the aim is to optimize the design (form) in relation to the use (function) of the products (“form follows function”).

Learn about the DNA of official statistics, what quality means and how to achieve it, especially under the challenges of modern societies. In times of data revolution, artificial intelligence and a ubiquitous flood of permanently produced and consumed information, orientation and differentiation of good and less good information, of fact-checks, and of verification of statistical evidence is crucial. The public infrastructure called "official statistics" plays an essential role in this respect.

As with other products (architecture, furniture, food, cars, smartphones, etc.), the aim is to optimize the design (form) in relation to the use (function) of the products (“form follows function”).</br>
There has been a marked surge in the way in which data and evidence are being used in new ways to inform policy in the United States. Although many blue ribbon committees are established whose recommendations are ignored, the U.S. Commission on Evidence-based Policymaking (Evidence Commission) has been one notable exception.Established in 2016, 11 of the 22 recommendations were enacted into law in 2018, including establishing or reinforcing leadership positions, planning processes, data sharing authorities, and privacy protections necessary to modernize the national evidence-building infrastructure. An advisory committee established in the law currently is mulling how to implement the rest, given the twin goals of increasing the value of data for evidence building through access while also ensuring the continued trust of data providers – trust that the access to data will generate evidence that improves policies, and trust that privacy will be respected and confidentiality will be protected. Yet, the interest and need is so great, exciting activities are already underway.</br>
Historically, states in the U.S. have been remarkably effective in their use of data.  As far back as 1932, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis argued that states could be “laboratories” of experimentation; that is, states could test the effects of different policies, determine what worked and what didn’t, and lead the way to national programs. States have proven Justice Brandeis right time and again – from Massachusetts’s experiment with health care reform to California’s pollution controls. Now states are innovating and experimenting with ideas about how to best use data to produce evidence and inform policy. A recent conference “Multi-State Data Collaboratives: from Projects to Products to Practice” provided a glimpse into a future of new types of collaborations, new types of measurement and new ways of protecting privacy.  The impact of many state programs – training, human services, criminal justice, and education – is often measured by the labor market outcomes of the individuals they serve, yet each state’s data ends at state lines. That situation has posed problems for states that know their residents often cross state lines to go to school, work, and unfortunately, become incarcerated, particularly when population centers are near to state borders. </br>
However, a  secure data sharing platform, established with federal dollars as a possible blueprint to inform the Evidence Commission at the start of its deliberations, has proven to be wildly successful in providing the opportunity for states to share highly sensitive data across state lines.  With additional philanthropic and state funding, the data sharing platform provided the core infrastructure needed to enable the establishment of a MidWest state collaborative in 2018 and a series of cross-state data collaborations.  It is a blueprint, based on a five safes framework, that can serve as a roadmap to additional collaborative activities to propel evidence-building forward at an accelerated pace – and how they can lead to new, critically-needed measurements resulting from the massive changes in the economy and society.</br>
This workshop will provide a discussion of the five safes framework in helping conceptualize and implement the joint determination of risk and utility. It will describe the Coleridge Initiative’s use of the US FedRAMP framework, as well as the FedRAMP approach in more detail, in terms of minimizing risk.  It will then work through the role of training classes in creating value.</br>
The workshop will feature hands-on examples of how the training class worked with active discussions of what might or might not be applied to the German context.'

  title: Epistemology and Theory of Machine Learning 
  link: https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/events/workshops/container/ml_2023/index.html
  description: 'The rapid rise and huge impact of methods in machine learning raises important philosophical questions. There is, in particular, an increasing interest in questions of epistemology: how exactly do machine learning methods facilitate or generate knowledge? Issues under this header include the justification and the fundamental limitations of such methods, their interpretability, and their implications for scientific reasoning in general. Since machine learning algorithms are, in the end, formal procedures, a formally-minded philosophical approach promises to be particularly fruitful for making progress on these issues. Such a study of modern machine learning algorithms can draw from a long tradition of work in formal epistemology and philosophy of science, as well as from work in computer science and the mathematics of machine learning. The aim of this workshop is to discuss foundational issues of machine learning in this formal spirit.'

  description: 'Prof. Dr. Håvard Hegre presents the VIEWS armed conflict early-warning system and discusses the uncertainties of armed conflict forecasting in light of a review of its performance. There are still several sources of uncertainty. At the most fundamental level, decisions to use armed force are always associated with aspects of deception, hidden agendas, misrepresentation and bluffing, as well as over-confidence and sheer incompetence. According to rationalist models of conflict, “war is in the error term”. Compounding the problem, the most surprising changes are also the ones that we are most interested in – early-warning systems arguable are more useful if they can predict the unexpected, maybe even at the expense of predicting the expected conflicts.'

  description: 'Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image AI-model capable of generating photo-realistic images given merely a textual description of the desired image content. This makes it possible to generate images quite easily without requiring special artistic skills, computer knowledge, or computer hardware and in a matter of seconds. In the few months since its release, it has become an enabling technology and platform for a large body of further research, numerous start-ups, and industrial applications. Having millions of daily users already and being among the fastest adopted open-source projects, Stable Diffusion has shown a great transformative potential with impact on many practical application areas. The opportunities, challenges, and the changes that the use of Stable Diffusion brings will be discussed in this panel with the automotive industry and image agencies as examples.

  title: AI-Talk by Yann LeCun&#58; From Machine Learning to Autonomous Intelligence
  link: https://www.ai-news.lmu.de/lecun/
  description: 'How could machines learn as efficiently as humans and animals? How could machines learn to reason and plan? How could machines learn representations of percepts and action plans at multiple levels of abstraction, enabling them to reason, predict, and plan at multiple time horizons? Prof. Dr. Yann LeCun, Chief AI Scientist for Meta AI Research and Silver Professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University will propose a possible path towards autonomous intelligent agents, based on a new modular cognitive architecture and a somewhat new self-supervised training paradigm. The centerpiece of the proposed architecture is a configurable predictive world model that allows the agent to plan. Behavior and learning are driven by a set of differentiable intrinsic cost functions. The world model uses a new type of energy-based model architecture called H-JEPA (Hierarchical Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture). H-JEPA learns hierarchical abstract representations of the world that are simultaneously maximally informative and maximally predictable. '
